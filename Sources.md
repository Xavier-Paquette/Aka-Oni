- different death animation depending on choices made in dialogue
- key + lock system with scriptable objects
- environmental puzzles
- backtracking required
- small hints to solve puzzles sprinkled in gameplay
- hide in locker to not get killed
- use a keypad to unlock main door - interactible GUI

- puzzles get increasingly more complex but never too random, dialogue clues are given
- dialogue triggers are used to explain some story, but plot is purposely vague- makes it more fun ;)

- Cannot fight back against enemy directly, there is a way to kill him though :)
- collect x number of hidden collectibles to achieve good ending (hinted at a few times in game)

-I have added a walkthrough MD file in case you get stuck, I want you to experience everything ;)





This game is heavily inspired by a japanese horror game I love called corpse party https://store.steampowered.com/app/251270/Corpse_Party/ that has one of the best soundtracks of any video game.
This game is also inspired by the Japanese folktale Aka Manto, which is essentially a modified version of bloody mary. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aka_Manto
