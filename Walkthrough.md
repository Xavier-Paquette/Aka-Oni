Welcome to the walkthrough! reading anything below this line is admitting defeat...
and is 100% not my fault for not making puzzles clear enough ;)

This walkthrough will somewhat spoil the (extremely interesting) story, so only read as last resort



*** FLOOR 3 PART 1***

1: your color selection will affect what death animation plays: red = stabbed, blue = strangled

2: start by collection the talisman in the sink at spawn. You will need 5 of these for true ending

3: walk out of the bathroom and notice a rock. grab it

4: walk into the classroom on the west wall (same as bathroom). Notice a red toolbox. We will come back to this later. Back left corner of this room, grab talisman in the desk. You now have 2

5: Use the rock on the windowed door (press E) to break through it and onto the next area

6: Keep walking into the classroom on the right wall. walk south to trigger dialogue, then exit room

7: hide in locker or run past aka oni (the bad guy :o ) down the stairs. You are now on floor 2, but we will be back to floor 3

*** FLOOR 2 ***
8: walk into furthest south room on the right wall, grab Hammer from shelf. Exit room

9: use Hammer on boarded window on the south wall -> aquire wooden board

10: use wooden board to cross gap in floor (it's buggy, might have to use it twice to be allowed to cross)

11: Now on left side of school, enter first room on left wall to find empty classroom. Top Left desk has talisman #3

12: Leave this room and go into the only other room on the wall. Walk up to desk and grab Red Key. Remember the red toolbox? ;) 

13: cross back over your wooden bridge, past aka oni and go back up to floor 3


*** FLOOR 3 PART 2 ***
14: Go back to room with red toolbox (Bottom left) and use red key on toolbox to aquire matches.

15: go to room with cobwebs (only room on the right) and use matches on cobwebs to burn them down

16: interact with Lily's bag to aquire a bundle of cables (just pretend Lily's family has an electrician and left them there or something)

17: interact with desk at far south of this room to aquire talisman #4

18: exit room and trek all the way down to floor 1 (past your wooden bridge, stairs on left side of north wall)

*** FLOOR 1 ***
19: Aka Oni is hiding on this floor, meaning you don't have to see him if you don't wanna, yet sadly im forcing you to deal with him. Enter the first room on your left, avoid aka oni and grab the fifth and final talisman on the desk. Leave the room

20: Walk into bathroom (entrance is south left wall) and grab the Blue key from the sink

21: exit this room and walk to the elevator. Notice the broken power box? use cables to repair the elevator (it was said to be broken in the intro dialogue, decent worldbuilding right)

22: Select floor 3 (i know, back up again...) and we can finally access the room that's been blocked off since the start. Use blue key to unlock the Principal office door and read the blackboard.

23: only important thing to remember is the number "1998"... you'll see why shortly

24: Take elevator back down to floor 1, walk to the right and then south. You are now at the main exit

25: Enter to password on the keypad to unlock the front door (1998)


*** END SCENE ***
Congrats! you've beaten the game.

if you managed to aquire all 5 talisman, the true ending will occur where aka oni is fizzled away by the power of the talisman

if you did not manage to aquire all 5 talisman, you will get 1 of 2 bad endings, depending on the color you chose at the beggining. Each color has their own unique zoomed in death animation.
